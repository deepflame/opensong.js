## Getting Started

Development on this project can be done on all major platforms (Windowd, Mac, Linux).

If you know current web technologies you should be ready to go.

To start hacking on the code you need apparantly to check out the source code. We assume you know how to do that.

### Requirements

  - [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/ "Nodejs") for your platform
  - gruntjs
  - bower

Nodejs comes now prepackaged with NPM, its package manager. To install grunt execute:

    npm install grunt-cli -g
    npm install bower -g

With the -g option we install the dependencies globally. We need this to be able to use the command line utility.

### Install dependencies

In the source code folder execute:

    npm install
    bower install

This will install all nodejs and frontend javascript dependencies.

### Start Coding

The project uses these projects:

  - [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/ "CoffeeScript")
  - [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "jQuery")
  - [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/ "Handlebars")
  - [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/ "Jasmine")

The CoffeeScript files need to be compiled into Javascript. This can be automated with grunt.

You can start a watcher that will automatically compile the coffee files. In your source root dir run:

    grunt dev
